# Optimal_Selection_System

It is known that the amount of data generated has been increasingly tremendous in the past few years due to 
Covid-19 pandemic, the ease of accessing the internet and cheap or inexpensive mass storage devices. The ease 
of transferring data through internet, communication lines and digital data are used in all walks of life. 
Nowadays, these big data have been used for data mining, knowledge discovery, machine learning, statistical 
learning, statistical analysis and experiments. In order to extract or discover useful data, information or 
knowledge from these big data, one of the methods we usually adopted is the optimal samples selection. 
In this group project, you are expected to extract a subset of samples from these big data. In order to extract this 
subset of data (samples), we have to make sure that the subset of samples extracted or selected should be as fair 
and unbiased as possible and also as optimal as possible. In the following we propose a useful method.
